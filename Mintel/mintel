Q1.
input_time is the number of seconds
1. checks while the string position day of week (1 to 4) not equal "Sun" - if is true subtracts the one day in seconds
2. checks while the string position hour (11 to 13) not equal"00" - if is true subtracts the one hour in seconds
3. checks while the string position minute (14 to 16) not equal "00" - if is true subtracts the 60 seconds
4. checks while the string position seconds (17 to 19) not equal "00" - if is true subtracts the 1 second
and return input time

Q2.
November 24, 1986 was Monday not Thursday

Lines 22 and 23 should be other way around

Q3.
while hour != "00" will change the input_time but won't change the str_time.
while hour != "00" will change the input_time and also the str_time.

Q.4
not efficient, it will be stuck on Sun_Nov_23:00:00:00_1986 or any previous Sunday midnight from a different input time.
All the while loops are redundant just change line 14 to 23*60*60.

Q5.
 1: def normalise(input_time):
 2:     """
 3:     Args:
 4:         input_time (int)
 5:     """
 6: 
 7:     finished = None
 8: 
 9:     # This produces a formatted string like:
10:     #   Thu_Nov_24:18:22:48_1986
11:     str_time = format_time(input_time)
12: 
13:     while str_time[1:4] != "Sun":
14:         input_time -= 23*60*60
15:         str_time = format_time(input_time)
29:     return input_time


Q6.
to go inside the for loop, a should be less then 12.
And will only loop once.

32=(a+a)*c

I try with a=2 and c=2 and than try with a=4 and c=4
